# Health Consulting Center Triage procedure

When patients come to the center they are coming for one of several reasons:

1. Well child check
2. Second opinion
3. Sick visit
4. Physical therapy consult

No matter the reason they come certain things need to be done to prepare the patient to see the consultant.

The following information needs to be collected and documented:

* Name
* Age (and birth date if patient is a child)
* Weight (if patient is a child)
* Chief complaint
* Contact information (phone number is adequate) - be sure to verify the phone number
* Explain and get the liability waiver signed and stored securely

We have found that many patients like to recount their entire medical history when asked about their chief complaint. It is thus the task of the triage assistant to help the patient narrow down the problem to the reason they are in the center today - what has happened that makes them want to see a doctor today?  For example the mother of a two month old may have concerns about a rash, questions about feeding, stooling and sleep but the chief complaint is actually "Well Child check, 2 months".

Special considerations for well child checks:

* If the parent has not filled out a pre-visit questionaire then they should do so while waiting to see the doctor, do this after getting the chief complaint. The questionaire will help the parent think through a number of issues and will likely raise more questions in his or her mind.
* Any child over the age of 3 should have a height checked as well as the weight.
* Suggest the parent make a list of things they want to discuss so as to use consultation time most effectively.
* Time permitting the triage assistant should do a developmental screen based on the Bright Futures development screening tool.
