# Connecting with Translation Clients

We believe that there is much quality scientific research happening in China.  Given that most of the world's medical and scientific research is published in English, in order for this research to be seen by the world at large reports must make their way into English language journals.  The majority of Chinese scientists have limited English skills, too low a language level to publish.  Papers by Chinese scientists are routinely returned with the publisher's comment "Please have native English speaker revise the article to prepare for publication."  We seek to offer that service.

We are not a publication body, we can not guarantee publication of an article.  We do not own any journals nor do we have a financial relationship with any journals that can ensure publication and favorable peer review.  We can only edit papers, make suggestions for language changes and (occasionally) make suggestions for study design and reporting.

## Process for accepting, editing and delivering an edited paper

1. Get the contact information to the editor.
	Scientists will often contact us via friends, WeChat, email, etc.  The first step will always be to get the client's contact information to whomever will be doing the editing for the paper.
2. Editor contacts the client, gives "rules" and gets a copy of the material for translation.
	Rules for editing ..
	* We do not guarantee publication. We can help with the language, we can't fix flawed science, study design, analysis, etc.
	* We require 7 working days for editing a paper thoroughly.  While there will be times when this process will take less time, we can not guarantee less than 7 working days turn around without making special arrangements (and incurring an additional cost).
	* Payment will be made when the paper is ready and before the final version of the paper is delivered to the author.
	* Payment may be made via WeChat, Alipay or cash.
4. Editor decides if material can be done well and estimates cost.
	* Our editors have areas of expertise that lead them to do better on some material than others.  If the editor feels that the final product will not be quality he or she has the right to refuse editing the paper.
6. Editor communicates cost and time frame for completion with client, on client's approval editor proceeds to do editing of paper.
7. Editing is done in word processor with "Track Changes" turned on. Comments left in the margin focus on translation questions or tips to write better.
8. If possible, second editor reads over paper after initial editing.
9. Editor makes a final copy of the paper, accepting all changes and deleting all notes.
10. Editor returns original, corrected (with corrections tracked) and final version of paper.
11. If necessary a call or meeting can be arranged to go over any questions on the material to ensure a quality paper.
