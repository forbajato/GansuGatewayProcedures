# Journal Club Preparation

One of our consistent income items has been holding journal club meetings for local doctors.  These docs have basic English skills and medical knowledge but often want to read English language literature and explore what foreign standards of care there are. Their goal is two-fold:

1. Improve English communication
2. Learn international standards of care for their specialty

To prepare for journal club follow the steps:

1. Get the article
	* This is usually done by getting the article directly from one of the participating doctors.
	* Sometimes docs will ask you to give them several articles to choose from, having a few in reserve for this is handy.
1. Read the article, highlighting medical and frequently mispronounced terms
	* Focus on medical terms but also include non-medical English, the mispronuciation of which can be jarring to a native speaker and interrupt communication.
	* Remember, many of the participants would like to go overseas to study at some point in the future.
1. Make vocabulary list with English word, Chinese word and pinyin
	* I write these in Markdown and convert to pdf - there is a script for that - use make and the Makefile in the repo
	* I have written scripts to search through past vocabulary lists for words, allowing me to copy previously used entries rather than look them up again.
	* I highlight words we have used in the past in italics, the vocabmaps.vim mapping will make this simple.  In vim source vocabmaps 
1. Print one copy of the article and enough copies of the vocabulary list for all paying participants
1. Contact docs on morning of journal club to verify that journal club can happen that day.
	* The hospital frequently calls unexpected meetings that are mandatory, you will never know if journal club will happen on a given day until you check.

Scripts for making vocabulary lists can be found at my github repo:
